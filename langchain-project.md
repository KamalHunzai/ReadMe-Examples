# LangChain Agentic AI Project

Welcome to the LangChain Agentic AI Project! This project leverages the capabilities of LangChain to create **agentic AI applications** that can autonomously reason, plan, and execute actions by chaining together various language models and tools.

---

## Overview

**LangChain Agentic AI** combines LLMs (Large Language Models) with tool use, memory, and decision-making to create agents that can perform complex tasks. The project offers a framework for building, customizing, and deploying autonomous AI agents that interact with APIs, databases, and the web.

---

## Features

- **Agent Framework**: Compose and configure various agents (ReAct, MRKL, OpenAI Functions, etc.).
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly plug in web search, calculators, code execution, and more.
- **Memory Support**: Enable agents to remember previous conversations or task steps.
- **Task Decomposition**: Agents can break down complex instructions into executable subtasks.
- **Custom Prompting**: Support for advanced prompt engineering and task-specific prompts.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new tools, chains, or custom capabilities.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/langchain-agentic-ai.git
cd langchain-agentic-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your environment:**
   - Add your OpenAI API key or any other provider credentials to `.env`.

2. **Run the sample agent:**
   ```
   python examples/basic_agent.py
   ```

3. **Try out an agent chain:**
   ```
   python examples/agent_chain.py
   ```

---

## Usage

- Create an agent by defining tools and initializing an agent class:
  ```
  from langchain.tools import WebSearchTool, CalculatorTool
  from langchain.agents import Agent

  tools = [WebSearchTool(), CalculatorTool()]
  agent = Agent(tools=tools)
  result = agent.run("Find the population of France and multiply it by 2.")
  print(result)
  ```

- Extend capabilities by plugging in new tools, chains, or customizing prompts.
